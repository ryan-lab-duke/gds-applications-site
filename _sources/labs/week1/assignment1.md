```{admonition} Deadline
Please complete this assignment by Jan 20 11:59pm.
```

Follow the instructions [here](https://owel-lab.github.io/gds-applications-site/course-info/python.html) to install the Python programming environment that we will use in this class. 

*****************************

## Task 1 (10 points)

### Create a new Jupyter Notebook

* Make a new Jupyter Notebook.

### Write some Python code

* Import the `numpy` package

* Add, subtract, and multiply two numbers using the `numpy` package 

*****************************

## Task 2 (10 points)

### Write some markdown.

* In the cell below your code, add an image from Google images of somewhere inspiring along with a short caption that includes **bold**, *italics* and a link to the webpage that displays this image.

The following [guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) contains examples of markdown syntax. 

```{tip}
The image should be saved in the same folder as your answers notebook.
```

* Add the title of the assignment as a **Heading level 1**, your name as **Heading level 2**, and the date as **Heading level 3** to your notebook.

*****************************

## Task 3 (5 points)

* Sign-up for a GitHub account and install `git` or `GitHub Desktop` by following instructions [here](https://owel-lab.github.io/gds-applications-site/course-info/github.html).

* Add your GitHub username to your notebook (e.g. next to your real name).

*****************************

## Task 4 (5 points)

* Save notebook as PDF and submit via Canvas by the deadline.

This can is a little tricky. We recommend using `ctrl + p` (or `command + p`) &rarr; **Save as PDF**. If you'd like to get the **File** &rarr; **Download as** &rarr; **PDF via LaTeX** (or **PDF via HTML**) working, you will need to install some other packages.

```{important}
Save your notebooks locally as both `.ipynb` and `.pdf` formats but only submit the pdf to Canvas.
