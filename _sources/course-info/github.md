# GitHub

In this course we will use GitHub to share code and collaborate on the final class project. 

## Sign-up for an account

If you already have a GitHub account, you can skip this step. If not, create a new GitHub account using your `@duke.edu` email address [here](https://github.com/). We recommend that you apply for the free "edu" account upgrade [here](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new) which will allow you to create unlimited number of private repos with unlimited collaborators.

## Install `git`

There are two options for installing `git`, the command-line interface (CLI) and the graphical user interface (GUI) called GitHub Desktop. We encourage students to learn the CLI which can be installed following [these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
