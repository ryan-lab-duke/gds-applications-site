# Project ideas

Now we have explored some different types of geospatial data (e.g. table, network, and gridded) in different contexts (e.g. urbanization, habitat loss, mobility), we should be ready to come up with an idea for a final project.

There is intentionally a lot of flexibility here. This can be an individual or group project, though we encourage you to consider a **group project** for two reasons. (1) it is more fun to work in teams, and (2) it will provide you with first-hand experience of collaborative software development in Github, a key skill for many careers. 

There are several options for choosing a final project:

* If you’re already engaged in **independent research**, propose a project that will move that work forward

* Explore a **side project** that is related to your independent research

* Propose a **new research question** that you have been interested in for a while but never had the chance to investigate. Hopefully some of the concepts we’ve covered in class will help you carry out the project.

* **Join forces** with others in the class who already have a project idea.

* If independent research is new to you or you are still struggling, **talk to the instructor, TA, or grad students** in the class to define a suitable final project.
