# Make a README

## Task 1 (10 points)

The goal of the activity is to make an outline of your group's final project. To do this, we will prepare a `README.md` file in your new GitHub repo which will serve as the landing page for your project. Note that you can continue to update the `README` as your project evolves.  

Review the [markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and use some basic headings, bulleted/numbered lists, and other formatting to organize your outline. We recommend using a **markdown editor** such as [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) for MacOS or [Ghostwriter](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/download.html) for Windows.

Please include the following in `README`:

* Project Title
* Name(s) of individual or team members
* Short 1-2 sentence summary
* Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s)
* Datasets you will use (with links, if available)
* Python packages that team members require
* Planned methods/approach
* Expected outcomes
* Any other relevant information, images/tables, references, etc.
* References

That may sound like a lot, but some of these items should only be 1-2 sentences, others can be short lists. Consider this the start of your final report.

## Task 2 (10 points)

Push all changes to GitHub and submit README as a pdf to Canvas. The markdown editors should be able to export `.md` files as `.pdf`

We would like to see at **least one commit** from **each group member** at this phase of the project, even if it is as simple as adding their name to the `README.md` file.

```{important}
Save your README locally as both `.md` and `.pdf` formats but only submit the **pdf** to Canvas.
```
