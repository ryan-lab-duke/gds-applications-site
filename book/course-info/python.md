# Python

Python packaging has never been pretty and it is probably one of the biggest barriers to entry.

In order to execute Python code for completing assignments, we will need to install a Python distribution with the necessary packages. One option is to use `conda`, a cross-platform, open-source package management system which can be installed using **Miniconda** (a lightweight version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)). 

## Install Miniconda

The latest version of Miniconda for your operating system can be installed from the [dowload page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links).

## Test installation

After installation is complete, we can test that the package manager `conda` works by opening an **Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)** (Windows) or **Terminal** (macOS). 

In the command prompt (or Terminal) run the following:
```
conda --version
```

If the command returns a version number of conda (e.g. `conda 22.11.1`) everything is working correctly.

## Setup virtual environment

It is good practice to create a **virtual environment** for each new programming project (e.g. this class). A virtual environment allows us to install Python packages for one project without worrying about conflicts with packages of other projects. Python has built-in support for virtual environments using the `venv` module. To create a new environment by running the following command in an **Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)** (Windows) or **Terminal** (macOS):

```
python -m venv .gds
```

That creates an environment called `.gds` which stands for *Geospatial Data Science*. All Python packages (or dependencies) for this course will be installed in this folder. Note that we could name this environment anything we like. 

Next we need to **activate** the virtual environment. In Windows this can be achieved by running:

```
.gds\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS, run:

```
source .gds/bin/activate
```

## Install requirements

We can install individual Python packages using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). The syntax is `pip install xxx` where `xxx` is the package we want to install. It's often easier to install multiple packages at once using a text file, so that anyone else setting up the project will have exactly the same environment. The `requirements.txt` file for this course can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uvwo4ppvb8ldn0f/requirements.txt?dl=0). 

We can install `requirements.txt ` by opening an **Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)** (Windows) or **Terminal** (macOS), navigating to the file (i.e. `cd Downloads`) and running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

```{note}
This may take a few minutes.
```

## Coding time!

Once we have setup our virtual environment that contains the packages we need for this course, we can start coding. In this class, we will write code and complete assignments using Jupyter Notebooks which can be opened by running:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to your course folder and open a new notebook by clicking `New` &rarr; `Python 3 (ipykernel)`. 

```{image} images/new-notebook.png

```

We can make sure everything installed properly by running:

```
import numpy as np
```

If this runs without errors we are all set to code!

## Deactivate environment

When we are finished with coursework, it is good practice to deactivate the virtual environment in the **Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)** (Windows) or **Terminal** (macOS) by running:

```
deactivate
```

```{note}
It is possible to complete this course without installing anything on your own computer. Look for the ![](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg) button on the notebooks to run the code interactively in a browser.
