    "# Automating raster analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class we have, for the most part, been working with relatively tidy datasets. For example, vector datasets with no missing values, gridded datasets that have consistent dimensions. But in the real-world, datasets are often messy. When conducting a research project, therefore, most of our time is actually spent formatting data so that it is convenient to analyze. This includes making sure that gridded data has the same dimensions, spatial resolution, and projections. In this activity, we will coach you through a typical workflow that we would use for analyzing many satellite images.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the activity is to compute the seasonal variability in surface water for a small region just North of Anchorage, Alaska. To do this, we have downloaded satellite imagery from [Planet Lab's](https://www.planet.com/) constellation of CubeSats. The images can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/t2bqd9811kn7y4brrsfoj/AGvCU_pJY3BujkZAQwE8GM0?rlkey=glpeflxxmwq8ggwh1c4gea8lh&st=w02v80y8&dl=0). These images contain four bands (Red, Green, Blue, and Near-Infrared) with a pixel resolution of ~3 m. Unfortunately, the images are not tiled meaning that the images have different numbers of rows and columns. This will prevent us doing calculations on the whole set of images. Furthermore, the images are projected in a geographic coordinate system (i.e. degrees) meaning that any area calculation will be inaccurate. In this activity, we will learn how to use [`rioxarray`](https://corteva.github.io/rioxarray/stable/getting_started/getting_started.html) to format the images to a common standard and track how surface water varies through time. `rioxarray` is a relatively new library that extends the spatial capabilities of `xarray` using functions from `rasterio`. It's a little clunky, as we'll see, but also incredibly powerful for geospatial analysis. Proceed by following the set of instructions below."
