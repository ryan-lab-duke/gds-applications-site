# Final projects

An large part of this course is the final project which provides an opportunity to explore a particular topic of interest using some of the skills developed in this course.  The rough schedule for carrying out the project is as follows:

* **Week 9**: After Fall break, discuss project ideas with peers and instructors, submit a short summary of a project idea via email. 


* **Week 10**: Form teams, create GitHub repo, and provide some basic info about project as a `README.md`. 


* **Week 12**: Provide informal update to instructor, ensure data has been accessed, goals are accomplishable.


* **Week 15**: Present project to class and submit write-up by the end of the week.


Students can work independently but we encourage you to consider working as group of two or three. Teams can achieve more collectively and it will provide real-world experience with collaborative software development on GitHub.
