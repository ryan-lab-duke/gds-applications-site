# Assignment 5

## It's competition time!

In this week's lab we will play a Kaggle-like competition. In these competitions, a host usually prepares a dataset and people from around the world compete against each other to build the best machine learning model. Submitted models are scored based on their predictive accuracy relative to a hidden solution file. 

We will be attempting to produce an accurate model for for predicting house prices. The data contains all houses sold in **King County, WA** between May 2014 and May 2015 and can be downloaded from the [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8nstpdxsyl6sntg/AADlAfMmL7xW7qzKPwlNbKL_a?dl=0).

*****************************

## Question 1 (10 points): 

Start by reading `seattle-house-prices.csv` and answer the following questions. 

* How many houses are in this dataset?

* How many **features** are there for predicting house price? 

* Are there any null values in this dataset?

* Which **three variables** are **best correlated** with house price (include correlation coefficients)?

* Which **three variables** are **least correlated** with house price (include correlation coefficients)?


*****************************

## Question 2 (30 points):

* Produce a model to predict house prices. You are welcome to generate new features, scale the data, and split the data into training/testing (i.e. `train_test_split`) in any way you like. You are also welcome to use the datasets contained in the data folder or other datasets that you find on the internet. 


* Evaluate your model's accuracy by predicting a test dataset, for example:

```
predictions = forest_reg.predict(X_test)
final_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
final_rmse = np.sqrt(final_mse)
```


* On **Monday** the instructor and TA will provide an **unseen set of houses** which students will use to repeat their accuracy evaluation. The best models (i.e. lowest RMSE) will win prizes. 


* We will evaluate the models using a simple `mean-squared-error` as follows:

```
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test , predictions)
rmse = np.sqrt(final_mse)
```

Save your notebooks locally as both `.ipynb` and `.pdf` formats but only submit the **pdf** to Canvas.
