# Assignment 4

Download the land cover data for this assignment from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ueleej8cr77kr2i/AACjQIouxEfUvo6A7ErSfgS0a?dl=0). The datasets are two National Land Cover Database (NLCD) products for Phoenix, AZ from 2001 and 2019. More information about the data can be found on the [Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium](https://www.mrlc.gov/data) wesbite.

*****************************

## Task 1 (5 points)

* a) How many rows and columns are there in the `nlcd_2001_phoenix.tif` GeoTIFF?

* b) List the northernmost, southernmost, eastermost, and westernmost coordinates of the dataset.

* c) Plot the land cover data for 2001 using [**qualitative colormap**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html#qualitative) of your choice.

* d) Identify the land cover classes of **three** random grid cells. The following table is provided as a reference.

```

* e) How many grid cells are classified as **Developed, High Intensity**, **Cultivated Crops**, and **Open Water**?

*****************************

## Task 2 (5 points)

* a) How many different land cover classes are there in the 2001 data?

* b) Aggregate all developed land cover classes (i.e. 21, 22, 23, and 24) into a single class.

* c) What percentage of the 2001 data is occupied by this new **developed class**?

* d) What percentage of the 2001 data is occupied by **open water**?

* e) Which is the **most common** land cover class in the 2001 data (as a percentage)?

*****************************

## Task 3 (5 points)

* a) Import the `nlcd_2019_phoenix.tif` GeoTIFF and aggregate all developed land cover classes (i.e. 21, 22, 23, and 24) into a single class.

* b) How much did the **developed** land cover class change by between 2001 and 2019 (as a percentage)?

* c) How much land was developed between 2001 and 2019 **in km$^2$**? Remember that each pixel is 30 x 30m. 

* d) How did the **cultivate crops** class change between 2001 and 2019 (as a percentage and in km$^2$)?

* e) Make a **DataFrame** showing land cover change (as percentage) for all classes.

## Task 4 (5 points)

Make a figure that replicates panels **b** (or **d**) from Figure 2 of van Vliet (2019), but for Phoenix.

The figure is from [van Vliet, J. (2019). Direct and indirect loss of natural area from urban expansion. Nature Sustainability, 2(8), 755-763](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dk51m44mlruz7l9/van-vliet-2019.pdf?dl=0).


*****************************

In the second part of this assignment we will be anlyzing some climate data for the US in 2021. Download the data for the assignment from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ueleej8cr77kr2i/AACjQIouxEfUvo6A7ErSfgS0a?dl=0). The dataset contains gridded daily air temperature (K) and cloud cover (%) over the USA for 2021. `t2m` stands for 2 m above the surface, the standard height used by temperature sensors. It is a common metric used in climatology but note that it is different from the surface temperature which would be the temperature of the ground surface.

## Task 5 (5 points)

Read the US climate data and answer the following questions:

* a) What are the dimensions of the dataset?

* b) List the northernmost, southernmost, eastermost, and westernmost coordinates of the dataset.

* c) What was the **mean** air temperature (in F) and cloud cover (in %) of Eugene?

```
* d) What day was the hottest and coldest in Eugene? 

* e) What day was the hottest and coldest in Florence, OR? 
 
*****************************

## Task 6 (5 points)

Find the following grid cells in the US climate data and provide the lat/lons **and** a rough location of where they are located.

* a) Highest annual mean air temperature (i.e. hottest place)

* b) Lowest annual mean air temperature (i.e. coldest place)

* c) Highest annual mean cloudiness (i.e. cloudiest place)

* d) Lowest annual mean cloudiest (i.e. least cloudy place)

* e) Highest **range** in air temperature

```{note}
Copy and paste the lat/lons into Google Maps to find the location of these places.
```

*****************************

## Task 7 (5 points)

* a) What was the mean air temperature (in F) and cloud cover (in %) in Florence, OR in **February**?

* b) What was the air temperature (in F) and cloud cover (in %) in Phoenix, AZ on **July 16**?

* c) What was the mean air temperature (in F) and cloud cover (in %) in San Francisco, CA in **Summer** (i.e. Jun, Jul, and Aug)?

* d) What was the mean air temperature (in F) and cloud cover (in %) in Bozeman, MT between **Dec 16 and 24**?

* e) What was the mean air temperature (in F) and cloud cover (in %) in Las Vegas, NV in **Fall** (i.e. Oct, Sep, Nov)?
