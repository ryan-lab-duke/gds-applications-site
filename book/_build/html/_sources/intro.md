# Welcome to Geospatial Data Science 2023!

On this website you will find the course materials for GEOG 4/590 taught at the [Department of Geography](https://geography.uoregon.edu/) at the University of Oregon in Winter 2023.

## Overview

The goal of this course is to introduce students to the foundations of modern geospatial data science. The course will be taught as a series of short lectures and longer computer labs that explore the major components of a data science project. In the first part of the course, students will learn how to analyze vector, raster, and network data in Python and train a basic machine learning model to make predictions. All examples and assignments will be based on "real" data with analytical methods addressing contemporary environmental challenges in the western USA. Next, students will lean other important aspects of data science including data access and visualization. In the final part of the course, we will discuss some general principles for effective project management (e.g. directory structure, version control, GitHub, etc.). A key part of this course is the group project which provides students with an opportunity to collaboratively apply their newly developed skills to topics of interest. This course will be best suited for students who already have some experience with programming and GIS. The skills developed during this 	course will be directly applicable to a career in (geospatial) data science.

### Learning outcomes:

* Improve programming skills

* Learn how think computationally and statistically

* Solve real-world problems using spatial analysis

* Run basic machine learning models

* Manage a data science project using version control

* Collaboratively develop a data science project

* Communicate results of data science project orally and as a short write-up
