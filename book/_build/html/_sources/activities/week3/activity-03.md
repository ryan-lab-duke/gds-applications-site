# Activity 3

## Census data

In this activity, we will be downloading our own data!

*****************************

* Activate the `.gds` Python environment by opening an **Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)** (Windows) or **Terminal** (macOS). Then, on Windows:

```
.gds\Scripts\activate
```

Or, on macOS:

```
source .gds/bin/activate
```

```{note}
Make sure you run this command from the **same directory** as the `.gds` environment folder.
```

* Open a Jupyter Notebook by running:

```
jupyter notebook
```

```{tip}
If you run this command from your course folder, your `.ipynb` assignment will automatically be saved there.
```

*******************

## Task 1 (5 points)

* Install the `census` and the `us` packages by running the following lines in our Jupyter Notebook:

```
!pip install census
```

The `census` package provides a simplified interface for downloading data from the Census Bureau's API. More information about this package can be found [here](https://github.com/datamade/census). 

* Request a [Census API Key](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html). You will receive an email with the API key - make sure you activate it!

* Test installation by first importing the packages and running the following (where `API_KEY` is your API key):

```
from census import Census
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

c = Census("API_KEY")
data = c.acs5.state(('B25034_011E'), '41')
```

The code above will download the variable `B25034_011E` for **Oregon** ([FIPS code](https://transition.fcc.gov/oet/info/maps/census/fips/fips.txt) = 41), from the **5-year American Community Survey** (`acs5`). By default, `census` will download the most recent survey data which is currently 2021. More information about the American Community Survey can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Community_Survey).

The variable `B25034_011E` represents the **number of houses built in 1939 or earlier**. A full list of variables (or tables) can be found [here](https://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs5/variables.html). If we wanted to download the number of houses built in 1940-1949, 1950-159 etc. we could make a list. 

```
variable_list = ['B25034_002E','B25034_003E', 'B25034_004E', 'B25034_005E','B25034_006E', 
                 'B25034_007E','B25034_008E', 'B25034_009E', 'B25034_010E', 'B25034_011E']

data = c.acs5.state((variable_list), '41')

```

We could then convert this **dictionary** to a `DataFrame` so that we can access useful `pandas` methods.

```
# Make DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Drop last column
df = df.drop(['state'], axis=1)

```

Finally, we can plot the data.

```
plt.plot(df.values[0])

```

*******************

## Task 2 (5 points)

Now it's your turn to download Census variable(s) for a place or topic of interest. Note that we are not restricted to states. We can also download data at smaller geographic units such as **counties**, **tracts**, or even **block groups**. See below for a summary of the different geographic units and [here](https://www.socialexplorer.com/help/faq/knowledge-base/geographies) for more information.

```{image} images/census_geographic_units.png

```



From the **README** on the [`census`](https://github.com/datamade/census) GitHub page, the syntax for downloading at the tract level is `state_county_tract(fields, state_fips, county_fips, tract)`. Note that two more arguments are required now, `county_fips` and `tract`. We can pass `Census.ALL` to get **all** counties and/or tracts. 

```
data = c.acs5.state_county_tract((variable_list), '41', Census.ALL, Census.ALL)
```

Otherwise, we should specify a county. For example, `039` would be **Lane County**. A table with the county FIPS codes can be found [here](https://unicede.air-worldwide.com/unicede/unicede_oregon_fips.html). 

* Download some Census data for a variable(s) for a particular place or topic of interest.

```{tip}
You can use `Crtl + F` to search for a keyword in the following [table](https://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs5/variables.html).
```

* Describe the data (and the geographic units) that you downloaded.

*******************

## Task 3 (5 points)

The data we downloaded can easily be converted into a `DataFrame` but it would useful if we could add some spatial information to the data. To do this, we can download a shapefile that represents the corresponding geographic units from [here](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2021/). 

If were interested in **tract** level data we would navigate to the `TRACT/` folder and download the `.zip` file for Oregon (i.e. `tl_2021_41_tract.zip`)

```{tip}
We can find the FIPS code for Oregon from [this website](https://transition.fcc.gov/oet/info/maps/census/fips/fips.txt).
```

Unzip the file and read the `.shp` file with `geopandas`. The two DataFrames can be merged using the following code:

```
new_df = pd.merge(geodataframe, dataframe, left_on=['TRACTCE', 'COUNTYFP'], right_on=['tract', 'county'], how='inner')
```

```{note}
Tracts are unique to each county but not to each state. Hence, there could be multiple tracts with the same value in these DataFrames. To join the DatFrames we must therefore specify both the tract **and** the county values.
```

*******************

## Task 4 (5 points)

* Make a choropleth map showing a variable of interest

* Customize the plot so it looks more presentable.

*****************************

```{important}
Save your notebook locally in both `.ipynb` and `.pdf` formats but only submit the **pdf** to Canvas.
