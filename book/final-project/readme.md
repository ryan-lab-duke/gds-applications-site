# Make a README

Now we are ready to prepare a `README.md` file which will serve as the landing page for your project in GitHub. Note that you can continue to update the `README` as your project evolves.  

Review the [markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and use some basic headings, bulleted/numbered lists, and other formatting to organize your outline. There are several **markdown editor** options. One option is to make one from a Jupyter Notebook (**File** --> **New** --> **Markdown File**). Alternatively, we can use a standalone software such as [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) for MacOS or [Ghostwriter](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/download.html) for Windows.

Please include the following in `README`:

* Project Title
* Name(s) of individual or team members
* Short 1-2 sentence summary
* Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s)
* Datasets you will use (with links, if available)
* Python packages that team members require
* Planned methods/approach
* Expected outcomes
* Any other relevant information, images/tables, references, etc.
* References

That may sound like a lot, but some of these items should only be 1-2 sentences, others can be short lists. Consider this the start of your final project.

```{important}
Save your README locally as both `.md` and `.pdf` formats but only submit the **pdf** to Canvas.
